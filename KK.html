							<h3>Problem</h3>
					
							<p>An underrepresentation of girls in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) related fields persists. An argument often stated is that women are not biologically designed for STEM but it has been scientifically proven that the differences are minuscule on female aptitudes to STEM. Thus proving biological differences do not explain the lack of women in STEM, but rather an embedded gender bias in our cultural expectations and traditions have deterred girls at a young age from following a STEM pathway. Girls are often brought up to believe that STEM are masculine topics and are less inclined to enter STEM fields because they perceive particular occupations as inappropriate for their gender.</p><br><br>

							<article class="col-8 col-12-small work-item">
							<h3>Solution</h3>
					
							<p>Young girls in North America are not pursuing STEM interests as current resources are ineffective in attracting and retaining female learners. The integration of the arts into STEM (STEAM) and early exposure to learning resources in childhood is necessary not only for developing innovative skills but also improving female interest and challenging pervasive gender biases. The attention on art, creativity and design within the STEM concepts is a natural fit as children are more likely to explore and experiment. Kitchen Kingdom is a game targeted to young girls that integrates STEAM topics through interactive and engaging lessons.</p><hr>

							<h3>Process</h3>
					
							<p>This web game is an online multiplayer RPG game and is based on fantasy and medieval themes. This is done because through research, girls prefer games with storylines, fantasy and online communities. The game is targeted towards ages 6+ as girls lose interest in areas like math and science as young as age 8. I decided to have learning code to be the main focus in tying in the other STEAM areas since engineering and technology are two of the fastest-growing fields today. While I was researching, block-based and visual programming is accessible and fast to learn. The game will introduce coding concepts through the use of visual blocks that you drag and drop to write programs, similar to Scratch. These coding concepts will apply to the STEAM learning challenges in the game. The whole game is based on cooking and makes references to culinary themes.</p> <hr>

									<h6>Branding</h6>
									<p>The overall branding has friendly and cute features to them to appeal to children better. The colours include a bright teal and blue to integrate a technology feel to the branding and children tend to be attracted to brighter blocks of color. The secondary colours are more earthy and orange to fit the Kitchen Kingdom world as well as to contrast the blue. Arial is used as the main font for body text as it is easily readable, making it accessible.</p>
